## Quasi SoC -- Build & Run

**Preparation**

You should first have RISC-V 32-bit toolchain with Newlib -- [RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain), probably configure with `./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv32_xxx --with-arch=rv32ima_zicsr --with-abi=ilp32 && make newlib`. 

Or you can use pre-built Docker containers including the tools: `regymm/rv32ima`

**Hardware**

Then run `make` in `firmware/` to generate SoC boot ROM. Or `docker run -it --rm -v .:/mnt regymm/rv32ima:latest` and `make -C /mnt/firmware`. 

If error occurs, probably it's just some minor path problems or environment variables, just export variables, modify `Makefile`, and fix according your own case. 

~~Use `eda_projects/pCPU-squeakyboard-vivado/proj.tcl` to re-create Vivado project.~~ Just create a new project and add all verilog files and constraints. See `sim/run_sim.sh` for an idea of what files are required. That's it, because no IP core is used. Clocking is (by default) instantiated via PLL or MMCM directly instead of clocking_wizard. 

Of course you should modify files in `rtl/board-specific/nexys_video/` according to your own board and peripherals(you can just disconnect input/output wires without disabling modules, no problem). 

Then run synthesis/implementation/bitstream as usual -- just take special care that no critical warnings about `result_bootrom.dat` occur -- boot ROM must be compiled into bitstream, while RAM and register inital values usually don't matter. It's recommended to have ILA hooked up to âˆ‚CPU program counter(PC) and memory buses, in case memory hangs or PC flies away. 

**UART**

UART is recommended for interaction, program downloading, and reseting -- instead of hardware buttons, SD card, or HDMI. 

Open serial port at 921600-baud with like `sudo picocom -b 921600 -p 1 /dev/ttyUSB1`. Picocom is recommend while screen is not -- when pasting a bunch of characters and transferring at full speed, screen seems to miss characters. Baud rate can be changed at `BAUD_RATE_UART` parameter in `quasi_main.v` 

When system starts, you should see messages like these: 

```
[bootrom]c_start
[bootrom]sdcard not found. boot from UART.
```

Or with `firmware/sd_uartbl/uartbl.bin` written to SD card's first sectors:

```
[bootrom]c_start
[bootrom]load from sdcard
[bootrom]xfer ctrl to 0x20000000

[uartbl] started. 
```

Input multiple `R` until LED brightness changes to reset the board. Then press `x` (or anything else, but not `0-9a-f`) to de-assert reset. So resetting can be automated without hardware intervention. 

See `software/uartboot.sh` for program downloading details. Make sure you have a 921600-baud picocom running when using `uartboot.sh`, or the `> /dev/ttyUSB?` will suffer wrong baud rate. 

**Software**

In `software/`, run `make run_tests`, `make run_coremark`, or `make run_renderer` for RISC-V tests, CoreMark, or the renderer. They'll be automatically compiled and downloaded via UART to Quasi SoC. You'll need HDMI for renderer. 

I think these three examples can cover most of the software flows required in cross-compiling(Makefile, linker script, volatile int* MMIO, ODR, inline assembly, call C in assembly, objcopy, patch BSS, ...). My coding habit is bad but they work(at least for now). 

Things like printf, string operation, float-point, and basic C++ are all tested to be working.
