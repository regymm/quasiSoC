## Quasi SoC

Crappy RISC-V CPU and fancy peripherals designed to be useful. Always half-baked. Prioritize compatibility over performance. Free-software toolchain ready.

#### âˆ‚CPU (partial CPU)

- [x] Multiple-cycle RISC-V RV32IM @ 62.5 MHz
- [x] M-mode CSR (partial but enough)
- [x] Interrupt (timer, external, software)
- [x] Exception (ecall, break, partial invalid instructions)
- [ ] Atomic extention (hardware or trap-based)
- [ ] Sv32 MMU
- [ ] S-mode CSR
- [x] Memory-mapped IO (1 host, multiple guests)
- [ ] Bus arbitration (multiple hosts, graphics unit or debugger)
- [ ] Formal verification (not planned)
- [ ] Pipeline (not planned)
- [ ] Supervisor/User privilege level support (not planned)
- [ ] GDB debug over openocd JTAG

#### Peripherals

- [x] ESP-PSRAM64H as main memory, 8 MB, QPI mode @ 62.5 M, burst R/W
- [x] Cache, direct mapping 32 KB(configurable)
- [ ] SDRAM (Easy but not before I get a better board)
- [x] GPIO (LEDs, buttons, switches)
- [x] UART (921600 baud), load assembly from UART, reset CPU from UART
- [x] SD card (SPI mode, SDHC)
- [x] PS/2 keyboard
- [x] HDMI character terminal
- [x] HDMI frame buffer graphics, 320x240 8-bit color or 640x480 2-bit monochrome
- [ ] HDMI quality of life
- [x] CH375 Serial, USB disk support
- [x] W5500 ethernet module
- [ ] LAN8720 ethernet module w/ RGMII (Hard)
- [ ] ESP8266/ESP32 Wifi module (Boring)
- [ ] lwIP? Need MAC + PHY(ENC28J60?) I guess...
- [x] Interrupt Timer
- [ ] Bus converter to use AXI/Wishbone peripherals
- [x] **Hart transplant**: use other RISC-V cores with Quasi SoC peripherals

#### Software

- [x] Standard RISC-V toolchain for RV32IM Newlib
- [x] Basic RISC-V [tests](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32/tree/master/tests) passed
- [x] CoreMark performance approx. 0.27 CoreMark/MHz
- [x] MicroPython [port](https://github.com/regymm/micropython/tree/master/ports/pComputer), deprecated, TODO: update
- [x] Fancy but very slow [soft renderer](https://github.com/fededevi/pingo/)
- [ ] Linux-capable **long-term**

#### Build & Run

**[Build & run instructions](BuildnRun.md)**

**[Free software toolchain -- SymbiFlow(Vivado-free!)](SymbiFlow.md)**

#### Alternative RISC-V Cores

Use other RISC-V cores with Quasi SoC peripherals. Currently PicoRV32 supported.
